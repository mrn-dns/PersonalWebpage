			<p id="mine">Being a person who was always passioned about video games, it ended up having, at a certain degree, influence over my life. This is why I am now studying Applied Computing(Common Entry) at WIT(Waterford Institute of Technology). I was born in Cork and lived there for 8 years after which I moved with my parents to Romania. I am now 19, turning 20 on the 4th of February 2020. I've always felt complexed because I left Ireland, so, I decided I would come back here when I finish secondary school in Romania. I feel just like at home here, seems like I made a very good decision to come back and I am looking forward to everything that the future holds for me. My website also contains links to my Steam page and my Youtube channel if you would like to take a look! :)  </p>
